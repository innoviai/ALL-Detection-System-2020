## Introduction

This project is the classifier that is used in Acute the Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System 2020. The network provided in this project was originally created in my [ALL research papers evaluation project](https://github.com/leukemiaresearchassociation/ALL-IDB-Classifiers/blob/master/Python/Tensorflow/2-0/Classification/ALL-Papers/Evaluations/Paper-1.md "ALL research papers evaluation project"), where I replicated the network proposed in the [Acute Leukemia Classification Using Convolution Neural Network In Clinical Decision Support System](https://airccj.org/CSCP/vol7/csit77505.pdf "Acute Leukemia Classification Using Convolution Neural Network In Clinical Decision Support System") paper by Thanh.TTP, Giao N. Pham, Jin-Hyeok Park, Kwang-Seok Moon, Suk-Hwan Lee, and Ki-Ryong Kwon, and the data augmentation proposed in  [Leukemia Blood Cell Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network](http://www.ijcte.org/vol10/1198-H0012.pdf "Leukemia Blood Cell Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network") by T. T. P. Thanh, Caleb Vununu, Sukhrob Atoev, Suk-Hwan Lee, and Ki-Ryong Kwon. The original project was inspired by the [work](https://github.com/AmlResearchProject/AML-ALL-Classifiers/blob/master/Python/_Keras/QuantisedCode/QuantisedCode.ipynb "work") done by [Amita Kapoor](https://www.leukemiaresearchassociation.ai/team/amita-kapoor/profile "Amita Kapoor") and [Taru Jain](https://www.leukemiaresearchassociation.ai/student-program/student/taru-jain "Taru Jain") and my previous [projects](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Classifiers/tree/master/Python/_Keras/AllCNN "projects") based on their work.
